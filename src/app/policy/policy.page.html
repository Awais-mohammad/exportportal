                    prohibited on the Site strictly.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">Listings of offers to sell or purchase counterfeits, replicas, or other
                    unauthorized items shall be subject to removal by Exportportal.pk.</span></p>

                <p><strong>3．Repeat violations of our IPR policy may result in a range of actions, including without
                    limitation to:</strong></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Removal of listings</span><span

                      your transaction is lawful and not in violation of any contractual obligation. Before posting an
                      item on the Site, you should carefully read any contracts that you have entered into that might
                      limit your right to sell your item on the Site. Some items, such as airline tickets, have terms
                      printed on the item that may limit your ability to sell that item. In other cases, such as when
                      you are distributing a company's products, you may have signed a separate contract restricting
                      your ability to market the product.</span></li>

                      posting items in violation of your contractual obligations could put you at risk with third
                      parties. Www.exportportal.pk therefore urges that you not list any item until you have reviewed
                      any relevant contracts or agreements, and are confident you can legally sell it on the
